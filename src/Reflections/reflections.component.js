                        The paper explores the connection between fictional
                        superpowers and visualization systems, aiming to
                        inspire new approaches to data visualization by
                        relying to the concepts found in superhero comics.
                        It presents two frameworks, one explaining
                        how visualization tools empower users and the other
                        classifying the underlying mechanisms of fictional
                        superpowers. The research explores a range of epistemic
                        abilities that can be observed in fiction, including
                        improved vision, cognition, attention, memory, comparison,
                        and prediction. These abilities are studied in terms of
                        how the media represents them as well as how they are
                        paralleled to the real world. This analysis provides
                        insights into the various ways that visualization systems
                        might empower people.

                        The paper uses an innovative approach by leveraging
                        fictional superpowers to inspire new visualization techniques,
                        offering a fresh perspective in the field. It provides a
                        thorough examination of various epistemic superpowers
                        found in fiction, exploring their portrayal, underlying mechanisms
                        and real-world parallels. The examples used for both fiction
                        and real-world technology are concrete and enhance the clarity
                        and applicability of the proposed framework making the analysis
                        easily comprehended. So do the figures, designed as comic pages.

                        Parallelism of fictional narratives with the real world
                        could also become a drawback of this paper.
                        While the paper offers valuable insights into
                        epistemic abilities, its focus on fictional characters
                        and sceneries, superhero comics in particular, might
                        restrict its applicability to a wider range of visualization
                        contexts. It could also affect the paper's accessibility and
                        wider impact. These may be restrict readers who are not
                        familiar with superhero comics or specialized visualization
                        principles due to its extensive reliance on pop culture
                        references and technical vocabulary.
